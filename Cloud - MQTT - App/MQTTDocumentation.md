# MQTT

The protocol used is MQTT to transfer the data between [gateway](..//Gateway%20-%20RPI//gatewayDocumentation.md) (Raspberry PI) and the [database](MongoDbDocumentation.md) (Mongo DB).
We choose this protocol for its easy implementation and its scalability which is necessary to determinate the wagoon thatt is sending the data

## JSON-LiveData Message Example

                {
                        "nrWagon" :1,
                        "Temp" :22.6,
                        "Hum" :59.0,
                        "Smoke" :false,
                        "Toilette" :true,
                        "Port" :[
                                false,
                                false,
                                false,
                                false
                        ]
                }

                {
                        "nrWagon" :1,
                        "Temp" :24,1,
                        "Hum" :59.0,
                        "Smoke" :false,
                        "Toilette" :true,
                        "Port1" :false,
                        "Port2" :true,
                        "Port3" :true,
                        "Port4" :false,
                }

When this message is received it is saved on the MongoDB database, it is also a check of the variable if there is some incongruention with the accepted value an error message is sent to the Telegram Group

## JSON-Command Message Example

Example for a change of temperature

                {
                        "nrTrain" :1,
                        "nrWagon" :1,
                        "change" :"Temp",
                        "newValue" :23
                }

Example for a change of port status(close to open or vice versa)


                {
                        "nrTrain" :1,
                        "nrWagon" :1,
                        "change" :"Port1",
                        "newValue" :true
                }
