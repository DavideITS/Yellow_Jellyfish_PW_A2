# MQTT

The protocol used is MQTT to transfer the data between [gateway](..//Gateway%20-%20RPI//gatewayDocumentation.md) (Raspberry PI) and the [database](MongoDbDocumentation.md) (Mongo DB).
We choose this protocol for its easy implementation and its scalability which is necessary to determinate the wagoon thatt is sending the data
